## Customizing Your CV

To personalize this CV template with your own information, you'll primarily need to modify two sets of files:

### 1. Customize Profile Data

The main data for your CV is stored in `src/data/profile-data.ts`. This file contains all the structured information that populates the various sections.

```typescript
// First, import your assets at the top of the file
import profilePicture from "../assets/profiles/your-profile-picture.jpg";

// Example of modifying the About section data
meta: {
  name: "Your Name",
  profilePictures: [
    profilePicture, // Use the imported asset
  ],
  pdfResume: {
    en: "/pdf/Your-Resume-EN.pdf", // PDFs should be placed in the public/pdf folder
    fr: "/pdf/Your-Resume-FR.pdf",
  },
  theme: {
    primaryColor: "#3f51b5", // The hexadecimal color value for the theme
  },
  socials: [
    {
      type: "github",
      url: "https://github.com/yourusername/",
    },
    {
      type: "linkedin",
      url: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile/",
    },
  ],
},
sections: [
  {
    sectionName: "about",
    data: {
      yearsOfExperience: 5, // Update with your years of experience
    },
  },
  // Continue updating other sections...
]
```

Each section has its own data structure, and you should refer to the specific section's README file for details on what fields are required.

#### Asset Management

For proper asset handling (especially when using Docker):

1. **Images** (profile pictures, company logos, project images, etc.):
   - Place the files in the appropriate subdirectory under `src/assets/`
   - Import them at the top of your profile data file using ES Module imports
   - Reference the imported variables in your data structure

2. **PDF files** (resumes, certificates, etc.):
   - Place the files in the `public/pdf/` directory
   - Reference them with absolute paths starting with `/pdf/`

This approach ensures that all assets are properly processed and included in the production build.

### 2. Update Translations

Translations are stored in the locale files under `src/i18n/locales/`. You'll need to update both `en.ts` and `fr.ts` (or any other languages you've added) to reflect your personal information.

In `src/i18n/locales/en.ts`:

```typescript
// Example of modifying the About section translations
sections: {
  about: {
    jobTitle: "Your Job Title",
    experienceText: "years of experience",
    summary: "Your professional summary goes here. Describe your background, expertise, and career goals...",
  },
  // Continue updating other sections...
}
```

Make similar changes to `fr.ts` with the French translations of your content.

### 3. Section-Specific Customizations

Each section has its own data structure and requirements. The table below lists all available components with links to their detailed documentation:

| Section      | Purpose                                  | Documentation                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| About        | Personal information and social links    | [About README](src/components/sections/About/README.md) |
| Skills       | Professional and technical skills        | [Skills README](src/components/sections/Skills/README.md) |
| Education    | Educational history and languages        | [Education README](src/components/sections/Education/README.md) |
| Experiences  | Work history and responsibilities        | [Experiences README](src/components/sections/Experiences/README.md) |
| Projects     | Personal or professional projects        | [Projects README](src/components/sections/Projects/README.md) |
| Hobbies      | Personal interests and activities        | [Hobbies README](src/components/sections/Hobbies/README.md) |

Each README contains detailed information on:
- The expected data structure
- Required translation keys
- Example implementations
- Component features and customization options

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd cv-react
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Using Docker for Production

This project includes a production-ready Docker setup that builds and serves your CV application.

#### Prerequisites for Docker

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine

#### Deploying with Docker

Build and run the production-optimized container:

```bash
# Build and start the container in detached mode
npm run docker:up
# or
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
1. Build your application
2. Create an optimized Nginx-based Docker image
3. Start a container serving your application on port 80

To stop the container:

```bash
npm run docker:down
# or
docker-compose down
```

#### Custom Docker Builds

To build the Docker image without using docker-compose:

```bash
docker build -t cv-react .
docker run -p 80:80 -d cv-react
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Using Demo Mode

To use example data instead of your personal data during development:

```bash
npm run dev -- --mode=demo
# or
yarn dev --mode=demo
```

To build using example data:

```bash
npm run build -- --mode=demo
# or
yarn build --mode=demo
```

## Performance Optimization

This project includes a custom Vite plugin that automatically analyzes your profile data and only includes the sections you actually use in the final bundle. This means:

1. **Smaller Bundle Size**: Only the components you actually use are included in the build
2. **No Manual Configuration**: Just add or remove sections from your profile data
3. **Type-Safe Detection**: The plugin understands your section registry

This optimization happens automatically during the build process with no additional configuration needed.
